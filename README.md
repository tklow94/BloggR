# BloggR
---
BloggR is a social platform for creating and viewing user blog posts. Users can assign various categories to their posts. Custom authentication and authorization was used to restict access and verify user identity when accessing resources. Admin functionality is also present.

# Motivation
---
Social media is an industry I am fascinated with because of it's ability to empower users to be their own brand and make connections worldwide. I wanted to understand the functionality behind the various components that are implemented in these platforms by building them out in this app. With this app in particular I wanted to explore utilizing clean OOP principles to create an application that shows mastery of Ruby on Rails. 

# Heroku

# Tehcnologies Used
---
# - Ruby
    Ruby is a flexible OOP language that allowed me to execute a proof of concept fairly quickly. Rails is a development framework which makes abstracting out tasks much easier and allows me to DRY up my code. Allowed me to easily add unit, integration, and functional tests.

# - Postgresql
  Postgresql is a program that allows me to easily create a relational database and view my data in clear and distinct tables. Assist with deploying to Heroku.

# - Boostrap
    Ability to dispatch easy to customize, ready to use, and professional styling components. Helped speed up production of my application.

# Features
---
- CRUD for users, posts, and categories 
- Admin priveleges 
- Assign a category to a post
- Unit, integration, and funcitonal tests
